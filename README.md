# Advance Statistics for Genomics
Canonical linear statistics (t-test, ANOVA, PCA) and their non-parametric equivalents. Examines application of Bayesian statistics, Hidden Markov Models and machine learning algorithms to problems in bioinformatics. Students should have fluency in a high-level programming language (PERL, Java, C#, Python or equivalent) and are expected, in assignments, to manipulate and analyze large public data sets. Utilizes the R statistical package with the bioconductor extension.</br></br>
